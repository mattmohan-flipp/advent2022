# Advent Of Code 2022

My TypeScript/Deno solutions to the 2022 Advent of Code puzzles

* Run `./Advent solve X` where X is the day number to run the solver for that day
* Run `./Advent template X` to generate a template for day X (if you've previously run `./Advent login` it'll also download the input * data from the API)
* Run `./Advent help` for more detailed instuctions
* Run `source <(./Advent completions zsh)` to get ZSH completions in your current shell
